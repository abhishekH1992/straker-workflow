```Nuxt, Vue, Vuetify, Tailwind```

git clone https://github.com/abhishekH1992/straker-workflow.git
```

## Future Scope
- Design Shapes & Lines with CSS
- Resize tool - write a more effective logic to resize these shapes (there are third party packages for resize like `vue-draggable-resizable` but custom logic for resize will be more effective)

- Store values in DB instead of localStorage
- Write a non-blocking/async API logic to store values in DB
